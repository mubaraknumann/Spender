## 💡 FAQ

### Do I need to download the SMS Analyzer?

Only if you want SMS automation. The app works perfectly fine with manual entry and file imports without it.

### Is my data safe?

Absolutely. All processing happens on your device. Your SMS messages, transactions, and financial data never leave your iPhone. We don't have servers, we don't collect analytics, we don't track you.

### What banks are supported?

The SMS Analyzer works with all banks that send transaction SMS messages. It's been optimized for Indian banks but works globally.

### Can I import my existing data?

Yes! Import from:
- CSV files (Excel, Google Sheets)
- QIF files (other finance apps)
- OFX files (accounting software)

### How do I backup my data?

Two ways:
1. **Local Backup**: Settings → Backup & Restore → Create Backup (saves encrypted XML)
2. **iCloud Backup**: Settings → Backup & Restore → Enable iCloud Backup (automatic)

### Can I export my data?

Yes! Settings → Import/Export → Export Transactions

Formats: CSV, QIF, OFX

### How does account merging work?

If you have duplicate accounts (e.g., "HDFC Bank" and "HDFC"):
1. Settings → Accounts
2. Tap the duplicate account
3. Tap "Merge Account"
4. Select target account
5. Confirm

All transactions transfer automatically.

### What if a transaction is categorized wrong?

1. Tap the transaction
2. Change the category
3. Tap Save

The app learns from your corrections and auto-applies them to future transactions from the same merchant.
